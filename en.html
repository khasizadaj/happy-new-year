            <h1>Happy New Year, <span id="name-in-message">Mr. Anonymous</span>!!!</h1>

            <p>
                I wish you to have people around you who understand you and support you regardless of time and
                circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this year (like last year), I wish you to pursue your own dreams and goals, not those influenced by
                others. The most important thing is to follow what is right and exactly what suits you.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest skills I learned in 2022 was how to communicate better with people, and I hope your
                life is filled with people who have this skill.
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy New Year. You are loved!
            </p>
